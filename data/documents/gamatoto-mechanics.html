    <hr>
    <p>
        Gamatoto is a very old part of Battle Cats that has, until recently, been woefully unexplained. Attempts have
        been made with varying success and accuracy in the past, but no known treatment of the topic before this has
        made as comprehensive a study as this. This represents about six months of on-and-off work by some of the best
        analysts in the Battle Cats community.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can’t be 100% sure any of the mechanics here are perfectly accurate; datamining is often not a source of
        absolute facts, but instead a matter of guessing what the numbers mean and validating them with comparisons to
        data. Most of the results here are backed up as being statistically consistent with a test sample of some 700+
        expeditions, so we are pretty confident overall. This is the best explanation we currently have, but further
        research may change this in future.
    </p>
    <div class="callout callout-danger">

    <h5 id="gamatoto-report">GAMATOTO Report</h5>
    <div class="alert alert-danger">
        <h5>Missing image!</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
        The outcomes of a Gamatoto Expedition are described in the GAMATOTO Report Screen shown above.
        We begin with some observations about it.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Each line is either yellow or white depending on if a drop was obtained or not.</li>
        <li>The number of lines you get depends on the expedition's length.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h5>Missing table!</h5>
    </div>
    <ol start="3">
        <li>
            You can get different amounts of the same drop on different lines
            (e.g., Cat Food×1, Cat Food×2 ; XP+1115, XP+1050)
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Other things like what the different white lines say, which Helpers' names comes up, and the time it shows for
        each line, are random choices shown for style and do not have any useful meaning.
    </p>

    <h5 id="lines-and-number-of-drops">Lines and Number of Drops</h5>
    <p>
        Each line in the GAMATOTO Report is an independent chance to get any of the potential drops in the area. First,
        the game rolls to check which item you can get on that line. The base chance to choose each item depends on the
        area. See a table of these chances in <a href="#item-choice-base-rates">Item Choice Base Rates</a>.
        For example, we can look at Traitor’s Trench:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h5>Missing table!</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
        These probabilities always sum to 100%, as every line is assigned one of these item drops. However, there is a
        second check to determine if you actually get the item. The base chance to get an item is 32%, and it is
        increased by your Helpers (as described in <a href="#advanced-details">Advanced Details</a>). When this check
        succeeds, you get a Yellow Line and the item chosen in the previous step. If instead this check fails, you get a
        randomly generated White Line and no item.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Randomly choose which item to try for (rates depend on area)</li>
        <li>Randomly choose if you get the item or not
            <ol type="a">
                <li>32% chance of getting the item</li>
                <li>68% chance of White Line instead</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        With this, we can multiply the chance that the item is chosen with the chance of actually succeeding in getting
        it, which gives us the chance that any individual line will drop a particular item.
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h5>Missing table!</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
        To then calculate the average number of drops across a whole expedition, we multiply these Drop Per Line chances
        by the number of lines you get (6, 18 or 36 depending on the length of the expedition).
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h5>Missing table!</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
        That is, the GAMATOTO Report for an average 6 hour expedition to Traitor’s Trench will have about 24 White Text
        Lines, 10 XP drops, 2 Cat Food drops, and no Catseyes, for a total of 36.
    </p>

    <h5 id="drop-amounts-and-caps">Drop Amounts and Caps</h5>
    <p>
        So when you get a drop of an item, how many do you get?
    </p>
    <p>
        This also depends on the item and area. Each item has a minimum and a maximum drop amount, and all values in
        that range are equally likely.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rules for drop numbers are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cat Food always drops either 1 or 2 per line.</li>
        <li>
            Regular XP drops have a large range (e.g. 950-1150 per line) that increases as you go to higher level areas.
            These are tabulated in <a href="#appendix-b">Appendix B</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Bulk XP drops in XP Harvest Areas (e.g. XP +10,000) always drop only 1 per line.</li>
        <li>Catseyes always drop 1 per line.</li>
        <li>Battle Items drop 1 per line, except in Evangelion Areas where they drop 2 per line.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Using this information, taking a 3 hour expedition in Traitor’s Trench with the above data as an example, we
        find the average amount of each item dropped per expedition (multiplying the average number of successful drops
        / yellow lines by the average amount of each drop) to be:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h5>Missing table!</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
        However, each item type in each area also potentially has a cap. If your total drops of the item exceed the cap,
        the excess will be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rules for caps are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cat Food always has a cap of <b>9</b> per expedition.</li>
        <li>Regular XP drops are <b>unlimited</b>.</li>
        <li>
            Bulk XP drops in XP Harvest Areas are <b>unlimited</b>, except the highest amount in the area which has a
            cap of <b>1</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Catseyes are <b>unlimited</b>, except in Catseye Cave (and Caverns) where they have a cap of
            <b>1</b> each.
        </li>
        <li>
            Battle Items are unlimited, except in Collab Areas where they have a cap of <b>1</b>, or for Evangelion
            Areas <b>2</b> each.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For example, if you get 5 drops of Cat Food ×2 in a single expedition, this exceeds the cap of 9, and so you
        only get 9 Cat Food from the expedition.
    </p>

    <div class="callout callout-info">
        <h5 id="inari-and-collab-helpers">Inari and Collab Helpers</h5>
        <p>
            Having Inari from the Cat Shrine present <b>doubles</b> the drop amount of items (except for Cat Food) for a
            single expedition. That is, the chance of each line dropping an item stays the same, but you get twice as
            many as usual (e.g. 2 Catseyes per line) when successful. Certain collabs (Merc, Shoumetsu, Miku) also have
            bonus helpers who act as a permanent Inari (you can’t have both at once), having the same effect on your
            drops.
        </p>
        <p>
            These also double the caps on the relevant items. (Catseye Cave can now drop <b>2</b> of each Catseye!)
        </p>
    </div>

    <h5 id="engineers-and-helpers">Engineers and Helpers</h5>
    <p>
        At the end of an expedition, Gamatoto has a chance to find a helper. The rates differ between Early Game and
        Regular expedition areas, defined here as:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h5>Missing table!</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
        The chance to find a Helper in an area depends on which of these categories you are in, the length of the
        expedition, and whether or not you have a full team of 5 Engineers.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, the area you are in determines the Base Helper Chance:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>For Early Game areas, the Base Helper Chance is <b>7.5%</b>.</li>
        <li>For Regular areas, the Base Helper Chance is <b>9%</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Next, the expedition length determines how many Attempts Gamatoto has at finding a helper:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 hour expeditions have <b>2</b> Attempts.</li>
        <li>3 hour expeditions have <b>5</b> Attempts.</li>
        <li>6 hour expeditions have <b>9</b> Attempts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The chance of each Attempt succeeding is the Base Helper Chance above. If it succeeds, then you get a helper.
        If it fails, you move onto the next attempt and repeat. If you run out of attempts with no Helper drops, you get
        no helpers for that expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
        If an attempt succeeds, the chance of it being each type of helper is as follows:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h5>Missing table!</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
        *If you have 5 Engineers present already, you cannot get more, so the current Attempt "fails" and you move on to
        the next Attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
        **Note that when Legendary Helpers are unlocked, you get them instead of Gold Helpers at the same rate. In other
        words, all drops that would otherwise be Gold Helpers become Legendary instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        Putting all of this together, we can calculate the chance of any given expedition giving each rarity of helper:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-danger">
        <h5>Missing image!</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
        From this, we can see that doing more <b>shorter expeditions</b> will yield more helpers on average than doing
        fewer longer ones. For example, six 1h expeditions in a regular area with full engineers will give six 0.14%
        chances at a Gold helper (average 0.84 dropped total) while one 6h expedition will yield just one 0.62% chance
        (average 0.62 dropped total) making the shorter expeditions about 35% better.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact, even if you are inattentive and in a 6 hour span only manage to send out <b>four or five 1h
        expeditions</b>, this will still yield an average of 0.66 to 0.70 gold helpers, which is still slightly better
        than the 6h case.
    </p>

    <h5 id="levelling-up-gamatoto">Levelling Up Gamatoto</h5>
    <p>
        Gamatoto begins his life at Level 1, and with every expedition, gains Experience Points which allow him to level
        up. This changes the chances of choosing each item for a line and is explained in
        <a href="#effect-of-gamatoto-level">Effect of Gamatoto Level</a>. It also unlocks new areas and costumes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Higher level Gamatoto areas drop more Gamatoto Experience, tabulated in <a href="#appendix-c">Appendix C</a>,
        and longer expeditions also increase the amount as follows:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h5>Missing table!</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
        That is, if you wish to maximise the rate at which Gamatoto gains Experience to level up, doing multiple 1 hour
        expeditions is slightly better than 3 or 6 hour expeditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, sometimes (20% chance) Gamatoto will randomly gain a bonus 50% Experience (×1.5) for expeditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The cumulative experience Gamatoto needs to reach a given level is as follows:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h5>Missing table!</h5>
    </div>



    <h3 id="advanced-details">Advanced Details</h3>
    <hr>

    <h5 id="effect-of-gamatoto-level">Effect of Gamatoto Level</h5>
    <p>
        Levelling up Gamatoto <b>increases</b> the Item Choice Rate of Cat Food, Catseyes, Battle Items and Bulk XP
        Drops (XP Harvest 10k XP, etc), while <b>decreasing</b> that of regular XP drops.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each item in each area has a "Choice Rate Modifier" which indicates how much the Choice Rate of that item
        changes for a given Gamatoto Level. To be specific:
    </p>
    <div class="callout callout-primary">
        <i>
            <b>Final Choice Rate</b> = Base Choice Rate + <span class="text-danger">Choice Rate Modifier</span> ×
            <span class="text-info">Level Factor</span>
        </i>
    </div>
    <p>
        where <i>Base Choice Rate</i> is the value discussed in the <a href="#the-basics">Basics</a> section (and found
        in <a href="#appendix-a">Appendix A</a>), the Choice Rate Modifier is found in
        <a href="#appendix-d">Appendix D</a>, and the Level Factor is a number that increases as Gamatoto Levels up,
        which is given by:
    </p>
    <div class="callout callout-primary">
        <i class="text-info">Level Factor = 0.02% × (Gamatoto Level - 1)</i> for Gamatoto Level 1 to 99<br>
        and<br>
        <i class="text-info">Level Factor = 2% + (0.02% × Gamatoto Level)</i> for Gamatoto Level 100+
    </div>
    <p>
        To be clear, it is 0% at Level 1, and increases by 0.02% per level until reaching 1.96% at Level 99. At Level
        100, it suddenly becomes much larger and jumps to 4%, then continues increasing by 0.02% per level.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, going back to the case of Traitor’s Trench from <a href="#lines-and-number-of-drops">before</a>,
        for a Level 100 Gamatoto:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h5>Missing table!</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
        Note that the total chance of getting an item at all is still bound to the 32% success rate — you still get the
        same number of White and Yellow lines — increasing Gamatoto’s Level only turns some amount of your drops that
        would have previously been XP into Cat Food or other items in the area.
    </p>
    <p>
        Converting these modified rates into average drops per expedition, we then find:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h5>Missing table!</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
        And then the average amounts of each item from those drops in a 3h Expedition:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h5>Missing table!</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
        We see that because the Choice Rate modifier for Catseyes is so high compared to the base Choice Rate,
        increasing Gamatoto Level to 100 effectively doubles the number you will get from expeditions in this area
        compared to Level 1 Gamatoto. Although it has a less pronounced effect on the other items, since the modifier is
        a smaller fraction of the base rate, giving you about 20% more cat food and 6% less XP. All in all, a good
        tradeoff!
    </p>

    <h5 id="effect-of-helpers">Effect of Helpers</h5>
    <p>
        Each Helper you recruit has a Helper Score depending on their rarity/colour:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h5>Missing table!</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
        The amount your helpers affect your Gamatoto Expeditions is dependent on the sum of your Helpers’ Scores. This
        is a number between 0 (no helpers) and 70 (ten Legendary Helpers). Each point of Helper Score adds <b>0.27%</b>
        to the <span class="text-danger">base Success Rate (32%)</span> of obtaining an item after it is selected on a
        line.
    </p>
    <div class="callout callout-primary">
        <i>
            <b>Final Success Rate</b> = = <span class="text-danger">32%</span> +
            <span class="text-info">(Helper Score × 0.27%)</span>
        </i>
    </div>
    <p>
        For example, with 10 Gold Helpers, your Helper Score is <span class="text-info"> 10×6 = 60</span>, and your
        Final Success Rate is <span class="text-danger">32%</span> + (<span class="text-info">60</span> × 0.27%) =
        <b>48.2%</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This means that you get <b>fewer White Lines</b> and <b>more Yellow Lines</b>. Unlike the effect of increasing
        Gamatoto’s Level, Helpers actually give you more drops in total, not just shift the ratios of one drop to
        another.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, there is an exception to this: Cat Food.
    </p>

    <h5 id="effect-of-helpers-on-cat-food">Effect of Helpers on Cat Food</h5>
    <p>
        The success rate for Cat Food technically increases by 0.27% per point of Helper Score too, but a second effect
        also occurs. Each point of Helper Score’s 0.27% extra chance for a Cat Food drop is cancelled out by adding a
        chance for Cat Food drops to turn into XP drops. In effect, this means that the Cat Food success rate stays at
        32%, but an extra source of XP is added to the drop table, like this:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h5>Missing table!</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
        That is, now the total Chance of an XP Drop Per Line is 40% from direct XP drops + 2.43% from additional Cat
        Food being turned into XP, so 42.43%.
    </p>
    <p>
        Turning this into expected drops per expedition type:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h5>Missing table!</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
        and then the average amount of each item per 3h expedition.
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h5>Missing table!</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
        We see that the main effect here is to increase the XP drop, due to both increasing the success chance for it,
        and converting some Cat Food into extra XP, though Catseyes are also respectably boosted.

        We conclude this section by noting that with both a higher Gamatoto Level, and a higher Helper Score, the net
        effect will be to increase everything. With Level 100 Gamatoto and 10 Gold Helpers, the combination of the
        effects of <a href="#effect-of-gamatoto-level">Gamatoto Level</a> and <a href="#effect-of-helpers">Helpers</a>
        will be:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h5>Missing table!</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
        The Catseye drop is enhanced by both Level and Helper bonuses to be triple its base value, the Cat Food is only
        enhanced by Level, and the XP is enhanced by Helpers but decreased by Level (though still increases overall).

    <h5 id="cap-corrections">Cap Corrections</h5>
    <p>
        In the <a href="#the-basics">Basics</a> section and then later in
        <a href="#effect-of-gamatoto-level">Effect of Gamatoto Level</a> and
        <a href="#effect-of-helpers">Effect of Helpers</a>, we obtained final average amounts per expedition by
        multiplying the average number of successful lines by the average drop per line. However, as explained above,
        some items have a Cap on the maximum number you can obtain from a single expedition. While the above
        calculations are correct in the case of no cap (XP, Catseyes in regular areas...), they are inaccurate in the case
        of capped amounts (Cat Food, Catseyes in Catseye Cave...) as they do not factor it in.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take for example, an <b>Imaginary Gamatoto Area</b> which only drops <b>Imaginary Catseyes</b>. Each line has a
        50% chance to drop one. In a 1 hour expedition (6 lines), you would then expect (50% × 6) or
        <b>3 Imaginary Catseyes</b> if there was <b>no cap</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, if there is a Cap of 1, then clearly this is not possible. To then calculate the average, we have to
        consider the probability of <i>n</i> lines yielding a Catseye using the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution" target="_blank">binomial distribution</a>.
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h5>Missing table!</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
        The <i>Expectation Value</i> (average) number of Imaginary Catseyes is then equal to the sum over each
        possibility (<i>n</i> = 0 to 6) of the chance of that possibility multiplied by the number of Catseyes you get
        in that event, which comes out to 3, the same as just doing (50% × 6) as expected.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, consider the same area, but with a Cap of 1 on Imaginary Catseyes
