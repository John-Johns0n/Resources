        (with some exceptions), but have a <a href="#blind-spot">blind spot</a> in their range to compensate.

    <h5 id="omni-strike">Omni-Strike</h5>
    <p>
        Units with this ability can hit enemies behind them as well as in front. Sometimes it also comes with
        <a href="#piercing-range">piercing range</a>, in which case it essentially functions as Long Range without the
        blind spot.
    </p>

    <h5 id="maximum-range">Maximum Range</h5>
    <p>
        Maximum distance at which an attack can hit. Usually equal to <a href="#standing-range">standing range</a>.
        If a unit has LD or Omnistrike this often exceeds standing range (e.g. Aphrodite, Cat God), but is never lower
        (e.g. Hacker Cat, Ragnarok).
    </p>
    <p><b>Also known as:</b> reach</p>
    <p>Not to be confused with <a href="#piercing-range">piercing range</a>.</p>

    <h5 id="minimum-range">Minimum Range</h5>
    <p>
        Minimum distance at which an attack can hit. Usually -320, accounting for the hitbox of the unit. If the unit
        has LD, it can be above that (in some cases above even the standing range, e.g. Golfer Cat) creating a blind
        spot. If the unit has Omni-strike, it is usually
        (<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/678400499522732051/790010475998871562/video0.mov"
        target="_blank">but not always</a>) lower than -320, hitting behind it.
    </p>
    <p>See also <a href="#inner-range">inner range</a>.</p>

    <h5 id="blind-spot">Blind Spot</h5>
    <p>Area which an LD unit cannot hit with its regular attack.</p>

    <h5 id="base-targeting-range">Base Targeting Range</h5>
    <p>
        <i>(still got no good name, thought about calling it demolition range but that may also be confusing, so
        something along those lines because base is also confusing)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        The distance at which a unit stops to attack the enemy base. Usually this is equal to
        <a href="#standing-range">Standing Range</a>. For LD units, this is equal to
        <a href="#minimum-range">minimum range</a>, for Omnistrike Units, this is equal to
        <a href="#maximum-range">maximum range</a>.
    </p>

    <h5 id="piercing-range">Piercing Range</h5>
    <p>
        How far ahead of itself a unit can hit relative to its <a href="#standing-range">standing range</a>. Can exceed
        the standing range (Aphro) or be equal / zero (Hacker) but is never less. It is obtained by subtracting the
        unit’s standing range from its maximum reach.<br>
        Here’s an example: Radiant Aphrodite has a standing range of 600, and hits enemy units in range 450~850 in front
        of her, meaning she has a piercing range of <b>250</b> (850 – 600) and an <a href="#inner-range">Inner Range</a>
        of <b>150</b> (600 – 450).
    </p>
    <p>Not to be confused with <a href="#piercing-attack">Piercing Attack</a>.</p>

    <h5 id="inner-range">Inner Range</h5>
    <p>
        How close to itself an LD unit can hit enemies (can be zero, or lower, like golfer). It is obtained by
        subtracting the unit’s minimum reach from its standing range. See the above explanation for an example.

    <h5 id="piercing-attack">Piercing Attack</h5>
    <p>
        Used to refer to units that can hit farther than their standing range, through the use of either Long Range
        attacks, Omni-strike, Wave attacks, or Surge attacks.
    </p>
    <p>Not to be confused with <a href="#piercing-range">piercing range</a>.</p>

    <h5 id="stepping-stone">Stepping Stone</h5>
    <p>
        A frontline enemy that is used as a target by cat units with piercing attack to allow them to hit the enemy
        backline.
    </p>

    <h5 id="frontline">Frontline</h5>
    <p>Enemies/Cats that are at the front of the battle.</p>

    <h5 id="backline">Backline</h5>
    <p>
        Enemies that have a high standing range and stay behind the frontline; usually used to punish the player should
        they push the enemy frontline too far back. The term Backliner is also commonly used to refer to these enemies,
        and also more rarely used to refer to cat units that have a high standing range.

    <h3 id="attack-timings">Attack Timings</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        For a more thorough explanation of attack timings, be sure to refer to
        <a href="attack-timings.html" target="_blank">this document</a>.
    </p>

    <h5 id="foreswing">Foreswing</h5>
    <p>
        Animation of an attack before the hit occurs. Can be instant (e.g. Maglev Cat) or extremely long (e.g. Crazed
        Bahamut, Enemy Filibuster). If the foreswing animation is interrupted by means of
        <a href="#displacement">displacement</a>, the unit will start its foreswing again as soon as it finds a target
        within range.
    </p>

    <h5 id="backswing">Backswing</h5>
    <p>
        The part of the animation that comes after the hit. Can be very short or extremely long (e.g. Awakened Bahamut,
        Bullet Train, Green Shell).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> while this is sometimes referred to as "rebound", the word rebound itself is also used to designate
        something else, that being a full-backswing unit (such as Maglev or Yukimura) being interrupted during its
        backswing and attacking again immediately.
    </p>

    <h5 id="attack-cooldown">Attack Cooldown</h5>
    <p>
        Time between finishing a foreswing animation (= landing an attack) and starting the next one. Immediately starts
        counting down after an attack lands and stops the unit from attacking until finished. Allows for walking towards
        the enemies should they get pushed back, otherwise, the unit will display an idle animation. If the unit’s
        backswing is longer than the attack cooldown, the unit will immediately start attacking again after the
        backswing finishes. If the backswing is interrupted and the attack cd is close to 0f, the unit can attack much
        faster than its attack frequency (e.g. A.Bahamut vs Sleipnir) possibly leading to drastically increased DPS.
        Does not ever stop counting down even while the unit is
        <a href="#displacement">displaced</a> or <a href="#freeze">frozen</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Not to be confused with <a href="attack-timings.html#time-between-attacks" target="_blank">TBA</a>.</p>

    <h5 id="attack-frequency">Attack Frequency</h5>
    <p>
        Time between the frame on which the attack occurs and the frame on which the next attack occurs. Used to
        calculate theoretical <a href="#dps">DPS</a>.
    </p>
    <p><b>Also known as:</b> attack interval</p>



    <h2 id="advanced-mechanics">Advanced Mechanics</h2>
    <hr>

    <h5 id="clipping">Clipping</h5>
    <p>
        Units moving into enemy units because they are currently being <a href="#displacement">displaced</a>. Can be
        beneficial or devastating depending on the situation. Often happens without consequences with slow units, e.g.
        Meatshields after using the cat cannon walking a bit into the enemy. Fast units can however cover large
        distances in a short time and sometimes intentionally or unintentionally completely pass some units and end up
        behind them.
    </p>

    <h5 id="speed-clipping">Speed Clipping</h5>
    <p>
        Units moving up a tiny distance farther than they should because of the way movement speed is calculated. Is
        more noticeable on fast units, as they cover larger intervals of distance in one frame, and only detect
        collisions after moving, enabling them to clip up to half their movement speed into the enemy in DU. Can cause
        odd interactions between units with very similar but not equal ranges hitting each other when they shouldn't,
        e.g. Li’l Nyandam and Camelle Variants.
    </p>

    <h5 id="boss">Boss</h5>
    <p>
        Bosses are enemy units that cause a boss knockback when leaving the enemy base and cannot be moved behind the
        enemy base by any means. They can, however, spawn far back enough for non-<a href="#piercing-range">piercing</a>
        units to hit the base so long as the boss never has the chance to move ahead on the field.
    </p>

    <h5 id="boss-knockback">Boss Knockback</h5>
    <p>
        Very large backwards <a href="#displacement">displacement</a> stretching
        <span class="text-danger">(how many?) DU over 47f</span> that occurs one frame after a stage boss is spawned,
        affecting every cat unit currently on the battlefield, and as such ignores units currently being displaced by
        any means.
    </p>
    <p><b>Also known as:</b> boss wave knockback</p>

    <h5 id="displacement">Displacement</h5>
    <p>
        Any form of movement that isn't caused by a unit’s regular forward movement. Removes the unit’s hitbox from the
        battlefield over its duration, making it unhittable and invincible, excluding Holy Blast against burrowed
        Zombies. Also disables targeting it, allowing units to walk past it. Includes any form of knockback, warp, and
        burrow. Displacement resets the animation state of the targeted unit to a displacement animation; either warp,
        underground or knocked back, resulting in interruption of any attack animations that may have been active
        (foreswing and backswing).
    </p>

    <h5 id="flinch">Flinch</h5>
    <p>
        Very short displacement spanning <span class="text-danger">(how many?) DU over 11f</span> caused by the sniper
        cat powerup. Can be timed by toggling sniper at the right moment, as it shoots once every ~10 seconds provided
        it has a target other than the enemy base.<br>
        The normal cat cannon also inflicts this type of knockback.
    </p>
    <p><b>Also known as:</b> sniper knockback, cannon knockback</p>



    <h2 id="abilities">Abilities</h2>
    <hr>

    <h5 id="uptime">Uptime</h5>
    <p>
        The duration of a unit’s <a href="#status-effects">status effect</a> ability relative to its attack rate.
        For example, if a unit attacks every 10 seconds and slows enemies for 5 seconds, its ability uptime is 50%.
    </p>

    <h5 id="massive-damage">Massive Damage</h5>
    <p>
        Deals 3× ~ 4× damage against the <a href="#trait">target enemy type</a>, depending on treasures. Treasures don't
        exist for White, Relic and all event traits. Exclusive to cat units.
    </p>

    <h5 id="insane-damage">Insane Damage</h5>
    <p>
        Deals 5× ~ 6× damage against the target enemy type, depending on treasures. Treasures don't exist for White,
        Relic and all event traits. Exclusive to cat units.
    </p>

    <h5 id="strong-against">Strong Against</h5>
    <p>
        Takes 0.5× ~ 0.4× damage and deals 1.5× ~ 1.8× damage against the target trait, depending on treasures.
        Treasures don't exist for White, Relic and all event traits. Exclusive to cat units.
    </p>

    <h5 id="resistant">Resistant</h5>
    <p>
        Takes 1/4th or 1/5th damage from target type depending on treasures. Treasures don't exist for White, Relic and
        all event traits. Exclusive to cat units.
    </p>

    <h5 id="insanely-tough">Insanely Tough</h5>
    <p>
        Takes 1/6th or 1/7th damage from target type depending on treasures. Treasures don't exist for White, Relic and
        all event traits. Exclusive to cat units.
    </p>

    <h5 id="slow">Slow</h5>
    <p>Reduces an enemy's movement speed to <span class="text-danger">0.5</span> for a specified amount of time.</p>

    <h5 id="freeze">Freeze</h5>
    <p>Stops any animation the enemy is currently in for a specified amount of time.</p>

    <h5 id="weaken">Weaken</h5>
    <p>Reduces the affected unit’s damage by a specified percentage for a specified amount of time.</p>

    <h5 id="strengthen">Strengthen</h5>
    <p>Increases the unit’s damage by a specified amount after going below a specified HP threshold percentage.</p>

    <h5 id="knockback">Knockback</h5>
    <p>
        <a href="#displacement">Displacement</a> that moves the enemy back
        <span class="text-danger">(how many?) DU over 12f</span>.
    </p>

    <h5 id="critical-hit">Critical hit</h5>
    <p>
        Deals double damage. Stacks with other abilities. Deals full 2× damage against Metal, instead of the usual 1
        point of damage.
    </p>

    <h5 id="attack-only">Attack Only</h5>
    <p>
        Only attacks and hits the target trait and enemy bases, but does not walk past other enemies. Exclusive to cat
        units. Should the unit's trait targeting be taken away by means of <a href="#curse">curse</a>, it will only
        attack bases until the curse runs out.
    </p>
    <p><b>Also known as:</b> target only</p>

    <h5 id="base-destroyer">Base Destroyer</h5>
    <p>Deals 4× damage vs bases.</p>

    <h5 id="metal">Metal</h5>
    <p>
        Takes only 1 damage from every attack except <a href="#critical-hit">critical hits</a>.
        All enemy units with the metal trait have this ability.
    </p>

    <h5 id="burrow">Burrow</h5>
    <p>
        An ability exclusive to (some) zombies. Once they encounter a cat unit in their standing range, they will
        disappear underground and resurface after advancing a given distance (which is different for every zombie
        enemy).
    </p>
    <p>Some zombie enemies can burrow more than once.</p>
    <p>Burrowing can be interrupted if the zombie is knocked back during its pre-burrowing animation.</p>

    <h5 id="revive">Revive</h5>
    <p>
        An ability exclusive to (almost) all zombies. Once these enemies lose all their health, they leave a corpse
        behind and revive with a certain percentage of their original HP after a given duration (those two numbers are
        different for every zombie enemy). Zombie enemies can revive either once or infinitely.
    </p>

    <h5 id="zombie-killer">Zombie Killer</h5>
    <p>
        Units with this ability prevent zombie enemies from reviving. The ability only activates when they land the last
        hit. If another unit that doesn’t have the ability lands the final blow on a zombie on the same frame as a
        zombie killer hits it, the ability will still apply.
    </p>
    <p>This ability is passive, and therefore guaranteed to activate on every hit.</p>
    <p><b>Also known as:</b> zombie kill, z-kill</p>

    <h5 id="barrier">Barrier</h5>
    <p>An ability that is exclusive to enemies, commonly found in Starred Aliens.</p>
    <p>
        Barriers have a predetermined breaking point: as soon as a cat unit deals damage in a single hit that meets or
        exceeds this breaking point, the barrier disappears and does not regenerate. The hit that destroys the barrier
        does not deal additional damage to the enemy. Any damage lower than the breaking point is absorbed and does not
        count toward the total damage needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        An enemy with an active barrier cannot be afflicted with status effects. Other abilities can still apply,
        including trait-specific damage multipliers.
    </p>

    <h5 id="barrier-breaker">Barrier Breaker</h5>
    <p>
        Units with this ability can break enemy barriers without needing to exceed their breaking point. If the ability
        triggers on a barrier, the barrier itself is ignored and the full damage of the attack is dealt to the
        enemy.
    </p>
    <p>This ability is chance-based.</p>

    <h5 id="warp">Warp</h5>
    <p>
        An ability exclusive to enemies. Cat units hit by it will be sent forwards or backwards by a specified range
        for a specified amount of time, depending on the enemy. If a cat unit is
        <a href="#damage-knockback">knocked back</a> by the damage from the warping attack, it will not be warped.
    </p>

    <h5 id="curse">Curse</h5>
    <p>
        An ability formerly exclusive to enemies, commonly found in Relics. This effect nullifies
        <a href="#active-targeting-abilities">all abilities that target specific enemy traits</a>.
        <a href="#active-universal-abilities">Non-targeting abilities</a> are not disabled.
    </p>

    <h5 id="double-cash">Double Cash</h5>
    <p>
        Grants double the kill reward upon killing an enemy (has to be the killing blow).
        Exclusive to cat units for obvious reasons.
    </p>
    <p><b>Also known as:</b> bounty, double bounty</p>

    <h5 id="survive">Survive</h5>
    <p>
        Instead of dying when reaching 0 HP, units with this ability regain 1 HP and reposition with a
        <a href="#damage-knockback">hitback</a> once.
    </p>
    <p><b>Also known as:</b> survive lethal strike</p>

    <h5 id="savage-blow">Savage Blow</h5>
    <p>
        Increases damage by a specified multiplier on activation. Although this multiplier can technically be anything,
        every savage blow unit so far uses a 3× multiplier.
    </p>

    <h5 id="immunity">Immunity</h5>
    <p>Immunity to a specified active ability. Does not exist for damage multipliers.</p>

    <h5 id="resistance">Resistance</h5>
    <p>Reduces the effects of enemy abilities by a specified percentage. Does not exist for damage multipliers.</p>

    <h5 id="wave-blocker">Wave Blocker</h5>
    <p>
        Interrupts any wave chains passing the unit’s hitbox and negates the damage from the wave that hits it. Does not
        negate the damage from the attack that created the wave.
    </p>

    <h5 id="wave">Wave</h5>
    <p>
        Ability triggered on a successful hit with a given proc chance and a given level. Each individual wave deals
        damage and applies effects in an area. For cat units, the first wave starts at
        <span class="text-danger">332.5 DU</span> away from the caster, for enemy units at
        <span class="text-danger">466.5 DU</span>. Every wave level past level 1 adds another wave instance of 200 DU
        to the end of the last one, extending the progression. The waves don't all appear simultaneously, but spawn
        <span class="text-danger">4f</span> apart. The first wave spawns <span class="text-danger">3f</span> after the
        attack hits. The damage is not instant, but applies after <span class="text-danger">8f</span>. A wave can
        transport other abilities as well (copying the result of the original attack instead of rerolling the chances
        for each individual wave). Wave immune units ignore both damage and procs from the wave, but not the attack that
        triggered it. Wave chains can be interrupted by units with the wave blocker ability, who negate and ignore the
        damage and effect of the wave level that hits them and every wave in the chain that would follow, for every
        allied unit.
    </p>
    <p><b>Also known as:</b> shockwave</p>

    <h5 id="mini-wave">Mini Wave</h5>
    <p>Identical to the wave ability, but deals 20% of the original attack's damage and has a different animation.</p>

    <h5 id="surge">Surge</h5>
    <p>
        Ability triggered on a successful hit with a given proc chance and a given level. Each individual surge deals
        damage and applies effects in an area, both repeating a given number of times determined by the surge's level.
        Surge has <span class="text-danger">375</span> DU width, with <span class="text-danger">125</span> DU being
        piercing range and <span class="text-danger">250</span> DU being inner range, with the Surge's spawn
        point as reference. The surge's spawn point is chosen randomly from its spawning area, which is handled
        similarly to LD, having both a minimum range and a maximum range which limits it. The surge spawns after
        <span class="text-danger">15f</span> of the attack hitting, lingering extra <span class="text-danger">20f</span>
        for each surge level. Surge can transport other ability procs as well
        (copying the result of the original attack instead of rerolling the chances for each individual surge level).
        Surge immune units ignore both damage and procs from the surge, but not the attack that triggered it.
    </p>

    <h5 id="suicide">Suicide</h5>
    <p>
        Units with this ability disappear after attacking once. If the <a href="#foreswing">foreswing</a> is interrupted
        the unit will survive and attack again, if the <a href="#backswing">backswing</a> is interrupted it will
        disappear after the displacement.
    </p>

    <h5 id="multi-hit">Multi-Hit</h5>
    <p>
        Units with this ability will attack multiple times in one animation. This implies that there are animation
        phases in between foreswing and backswing. Timings can be vastly different. If the animation is interrupted by
        displacement before the last hit lands, in other words before the backswing starts, attack cooldown will not
        start and the attack animation will start from the beginning, repeating every hit. Every individual hit is
        independent, meaning it can have its own damage value (e.g. Awakened Bahamut with 3 attacks: 85,000, 3400, 5100)
        and abilities (e.g. Crazed Moneko, only last hit crits). The maximum number of multihits is 3.
    </p>
