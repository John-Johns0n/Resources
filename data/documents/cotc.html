    <h5 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h5>
    <p>
        This guide is an unofficial sequel to the <a href="itf.html" target="_blank">Into the Future guide</a>. However,
        this guide does not cover Crazed/Manic units or SoL in detail, focusing on Cats of the Cosmos (CotC) only. It is
        recommended to read the ItF guide first if you haven't already, as it contains a good amount of useful
        information, namely treasure mechanics.
    </p>



    <h3 id="when-to-start-cotc">When should I start CotC?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        It is strongly recommended to complete all three Into the Future chapters (and collect all available treasures)
        before diving into CotC. Even though ItF crystals do not affect the magnifications of starred aliens, unstarred
        aliens are a common occurrence in CotC. Plus, Awakened Bahamut is a powerful asset you will want to have by your
        side for this. Not to mention completing ItF also gives you access to talents.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's an example of progression you can use as a general guideline:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>ItF Ch. III + SoL 1 - 18</li>
        <li>CotC Ch. I & II</li>
        <li>SoL 19 - 49</li>
        <li>UL 1</li>
        <li>CotC Ch. III</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Why this order?
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            You need Awakened Bahamut and Ururun Wolf for some Special-only restriction stages
            (which will be covered later).
        </li>
        <li>
            CotC chapters I & II aren't very different in terms of difficulty, so you should be able to complete the two
            of them in a row without much problem if you have good units on your side and make sure to collect treasures.
        </li>
        <li>CotC fruits are good to have for late SoL (as are ItF fruits).</li>
        <li>
            Starting with subchapter 43 (Area 22), SoL features starred aliens. You need at least the crystal treasures
            from chapter I to have a chance, and collecting the treasures from chapter II will let you breeze through
            until UL 13.
        </li>
        <li>
            CotC ch. III has a sharp difficulty spike. It is highly recommended to collect all treasures from the first
            two chapters before diving into the third one, as starred aliens in CotC ch. III have very high
            magnifications (around 100% in ch. I, 250-500% in ch. II and 1000-2300% in ch. III).
        </li>
        <li>
            While it is far from mandatory, having access to level 50 units and Legend True Forms is a nice plus,
            especially for some restricted stages.
        </li>
        <li>
            UL 13+ features starred aliens with very high magnifications (around 2000%), forcing you to collect all
            crystals from CotC I - III.
        </li>
    </ol>



    <h3 id="treasures-and-why-they-matter">Treasures available in CotC, and why they matter</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Whereas EoC and ItF feature frequent treasure festivals, CotC festivals are considerably less common (at least
        in BCEN). Nevertheless, collecting treasures is still as important as ever— possibly even more so here.
    </p>

    <h5 id="mystery-mask">Mystery Mask</h5>
    <p>
        At the end of each chapter, you have to face Cat God. He has a default magnification of 1100%, and the only way
        to lower it is to collect the Mystery Mask treasure (1% on the treasure = –10% to Cat God's magnification). The
        Mystery Mask treasure only affects one chapter at a time (i.e. the one from chapter I doesn't affect Cat God's
        magnification in the other two chapters).
    </p>
    <p><b>Farming priority: <u>Mandatory</u></b></p>

    <h5 id="crystals">Crystals</h5>
    <p>
        Similar deal as ItF crystals. Once again, it is strongly recommended to get all treasures as you progress
        through the stages, as magnifications can ramp up in the middle of the chapter.
    </p>
    <p><b>Farming priority: Very high</b></p>

    <h5 id="fruits">Fruits</h5>
    <p>Not mandatory, but good to have in general.</p>
    <p><b>Farming priority:</b> <u>Medium</u></p>

    <h5 id="energy-and-xp-rewards">Energy and XP rewards</h5>
    <p>Not needed, but good for making progression easier without affecting in-battle gameplay.</p>
    <p><b>Farming priority: </b>Low</p>

    <h4 id="supplemental-treasure-farming-notes">Supplemental notes on treasure grinding</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Starred Aliens have a base magnification at 1600%. Each (completed) crystal treasure set decreases their
            magnification by 100% (eventually bringing the default magnification down to 100%). The magnification is
            multiplicative, not additive: this means that a 200% Starred Alien enemy would have a default magnification
            of 3200% (200% × 1600%).
        </li>
        <li>ItF crystals have no effect on starred aliens, but they do affect unstarred aliens appearing in CotC.</li>
        <li>BCEN only has a scheduled treasure festival on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of every month.</li>
        <li>BCJP has scheduled festivals every day.</li>
        <li>
            It is generally considered acceptable to use treasure radars on some of the later CotC III stages, such as
            Skelling and Andromeda, due to their notable difficulty.
        </li>
    </ul>



    <h3 id="deploy-restrictions">Deploy Restrictions</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Most stages in CotC have deploy restrictions, with one of them having two and a handful having none. Here are all
        the possible restrictions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Normal, Rare, Super Rare, Uber Rare, Legend Rare Cats only</li>
        <li>Normal, Special, Uber Rare, Legend Rare Cats only</li>
        <li>Special, Rare, Uber Rare, Legend Rare Cats only</li>
        <li>Special, Rare, Super Rare Cats only</li>
        <li>Special Cats only</li>
        <li>Cats with ≥300¢ deployment cost</li>
        <li>Cats with ≤1200¢ deployment cost</li>
        <li>Cats with ≥1200¢ deployment cost</li>
        <li>Cats with ≤4000¢ deployment cost</li>
        <li>MAX number of 20 Cats (as opposed to the usual cat limit of 50)</li>
        <li>MAX number of 15 Cats</li>
        <li>MAX number of 10 Cats</li>
        <li>First row (5 slots) only</li>
    </ul>



    <h3 id="gacha-units-and-preparation">Gacha Units and Preparations</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4 id="mandatory-units">Mandatory Units</h4>
    <p>
        The following units/things are <u>highly recommended</u> and you should ideally obtain them before diving
        into CotC:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>100% EoC ch. I - III + ItF ch. I - III treasures</li>
        <li>Awakened Bahamut Cat</li>
        <li>Ururun Wolf</li>
        <li>Every Crazed Cat except Crazed Moneko</li>
        <li>
            Li’l Macho Legs <i>or</i> Loincloth Cat (to break barriers in special units only restriction in Ch. II/III)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="recommended-true-forms">Recommended True Forms</h4>
    <p>Asterisks* indicate units that need a boost from talents before being good enough for CotC usage.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Seafarer</b> (Surfer / Castaway)
            <ul>
                <li>Most of the dangerous starred aliens have short range, and seafarer can counter them very well.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Chill</b> (Wheel / Solar)
            <ul>
                <li>Good for more or less the same reasons as Seafarer, but focuses on damage rather than CC.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Catellite</b> (Rover / Rover Mk II)
            <ul>
                <li>Meatshield with warp immunity, good to have for some warp-heavy stages.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Can Can</b> (Hip Hop / Dancing Flasher)
            <ul>
                <li>Extremely good physical stats, even better with talents.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Corrupted Psychocat</b> (Psychocat / Neo Psychocat)
            <ul>
                <li>Can assist Seafarer against some of the more threatening aliens like Nimoy Bore.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>iCat</b> (Apple Cat / Face Cat)
            <ul>
                <li>For some of the stages that feature red enemies (Bore)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>The Kitty of Liberty</b> (Fencer / Kendo)
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Great to have around, especially for enemies whose barriers can't be broken by other means
                    (UltraBaaBaa)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Cameraman</b> (Mer-cat / Commando)
        </li>
        <li><b>Pizza</b> (Weightlifter / Ring Girl)
        </li>
        <li><b>Roe*</b> (Sushi / Fried Shrimp)
        </li>
        <li><b>Cyberpunk*</b> (Nerd / Hacker)
            <ul>
                <li>Pretty much only needed for a handful of stages in chapter III</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Honorable mention: <b>Miter Saw Cat</b> (doesn't have a true form as of BCEN 10.5, but still performs very
            well in CotC overall)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <u>Note:</u> None of these true forms are mandatory. You can skip any of them if you wish, but they are among
        the most helpful to get.
    </p>

    <h4 id="recommended-talents">Recommended Talents</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Can Can Cat – Extra money (bounty) + Speed Up</li>
        <li>Cyberpunk Cat – Barrier Breaker + Slow Up</li>
        <li>Pizza Cat – Wave attack</li>
        <li>
            Roe Cat – Cost down <u>to level 5</u>
            (1200¢ price is compatible with both ≤1200¢ and ≥1200¢ deployment cost restrictions)
        </li>
        <li>Chill Cat – Cost Down (NOT knockback, it makes the unit worse)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <u>Note:</u> Again, none of these talents are mandatory. You can skip any of them if you wish, but they are
        among the most helpful to get.
    </p>

    <h4 id="recommended-banners">Recommended Gacha Banners</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Dark Heroes</li>
        <li>Almighties</li>
        <li>Ultra Souls</li>
        <li>Elemental Pixies</li>
    </ul>



    <h3 id="roadblocks-and-getting-stuck">A point on roadblock stages and "getting stuck"</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        It is likely you will encounter a roadblock at least once when playing through CotC. Here are some tips to help
        with the situation:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you go in blind and lose to a stage, make sure to study the schematics and adjust your lineup accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>Are you missing any crucial units or true forms to beat the stage? If yes, consider getting them.</li>
        <li>Consider grinding treasures if you haven't already. Any activated crystal helps a lot.</li>
        <li>
            If you fail in Big Bang (Cat God) stages, there is a high chance that you do not have the Mystery Mask at
            full power. The first thing you should do is getting the Mystery Mask to 100%.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you still fail after doing all the above, you should look for reliable help. The best places for it are
            YouTube tutorial videos and Discord servers.
        </li>
    </ul>
