# Resources

This is a project to convert documents and resources from the r/battlecats Discord community to a web format.
You can find most of them online [here](https://thanksfeanor.pythonanywhere.com/guides/top.html).


### Current roadmap
The project is already well under way, with plans to convert the following documents in the next few weeks:
- Gamatoto Mechanics (credit: ThanksFëanor)
- Legend Quest info & details (credit: JonesHtog)
- Improving your Legend Quest winrate (credit: Waran-Ess)

It is likely others will come after these, though nothing has been confirmed as of now (2021/07/12).
